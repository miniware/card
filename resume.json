    "summary": "Huge nerd, specializing in being a generalist – I’ve been a waiter, designer, coder, fry cook, advisor, graphic artist, manager, taste-tester, speaker, sculpter, printer, actor, furniture mover, high school teacher, and just about everything in between. All of these jobs have one thing in common: an absurd amount of extra steps between you and what you woke up for.\n\nNow I’m on a personal mission: reduce the work between the work, wherever I can.\n\nI’m highly passionate about teaching, especially when it comes to helping others create better. That means collaboration, organizational design, and generally “how do people / groups get things out of their brain and into the world?” are things I think about every day.",
