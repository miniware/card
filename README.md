## Forking

If you want to fork this project and make your own card, you can do so by editing the `resume.json` file. This follows the [JSON Resume Schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/), though not all fields are currently supported â€” you can add them by modifying the `build.js`.

You can then run `npm run build` to generate a new `bin/output` file. You can then commit and push your changes to GitHub and use `npx <your-github-username>/card` to see your new card.
